## The awakening of my excitement for traveling the world

As a working class mexican citizen, I never thought I would have the opportunity to travel this young, and even less to a country as exotic as India after going to the US. But life is full of surprises, and I was lucky enough to be invited to visit the ZOHO headquarters in Chennai, India.

## India Engineers and the ZOHO experience

Man, my whole team went there, we met our other colleagues from India. The purpose was to get to know each other and discuss the projects we were working on. I stayed there 2 weeks. Indian work culture is so astonishing. Don't doubt about it, indians are ones of the most hardworking people in the world. Sadly, their work is not well paid, very competitive, stressful, hard, it's a tough environment. But they are very friendly and welcoming.

I have so much fun with the team, I truly like them. Specially, my lead, Malini, she is a very smart and kind person. She is a great leader. They treated us so good I felt so comfortable since day 1.

The HQ was as expected, very full, we would prefer to use the stairs instead of the elevator.

Anyways, it's huge there, zoho provided so many jobs, where they could eat, walk, go on bike, transportation, events, gifts. It really feels are like india's google
